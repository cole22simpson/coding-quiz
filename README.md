# Coding Quiz

## What it does

This quiz consists of five questions. The quiz starts when you click "Start". After this, a timer counts down and the user is supposed to answer all questions correctly before the timer runs out. If the user gets a question wrong, the time is reduced by 10 seconds. If the timer runs out, the game ends. If all questions are answered correctly before the time runs out, the remaining time will be their score. There is a place for High Scores to be kept, but there were some issues.

## Issues I ran into

-I was having a hard time getting my timer to stop if I finished the quiz with extra time.
-The functionality of the quiz itself is all there, but when it came to the final score, I couldn't seem to set one because my clock wouldn't stop.
-When the timer runs out, it wants to create the elements necessary for the high score page once every second.
-Because i couldn't get my timer to stop, my score wasn't final, therefore I was unable to store my scores in the localStorage.
-There are other issues like my terrible ability to style pages, but these are a part of the acceptance criteria.
